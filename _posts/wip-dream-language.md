Here is what I want my dream language to be
What kinds of problems this dream language should be trying to solve?

## Name
It should have a name that is at least 2 syllables long. It should be nice to pronounce. It should not be a generic word like rust or go. You don't have to add suffix "lang" in a search term to find information about it on the internet.

## Performance and size are priorities from day 1
## Expressive power

## Less code, faster feedback
It is not known whether statically or dynamically typed languages produce more reliable programs. Dynamic languages allow  summing strings and numbers. 
Faster feedback
## First-class dependencies
When importing a namespace, I should be able to refer to it by more than a name: maybe a version or even a full repo url:
```
import https://github.com/user/library@v12
```
During develop
It's probably tedious to repeat it in every
## Release-debug separation
## Cross-platform
## Immutability
## Type system
## Static-dynamic synergy 
## Macros
## Optimisation
## Greppable
## Testing support 
## ide support
## formatter
## development over time
## No implementation inheritance
### Epilogue
No silver bullet.
