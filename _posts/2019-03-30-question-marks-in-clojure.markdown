Clojure's flexible syntax allows special characters such `?`, `!` or `*` to be a part of variable names, which gives ability to enhance symbols with additional meaning, but I regularly see that `?`-suffixes get misused, so I decided to make a list of dos and donts regarding question marks to clear that up.

## Do: Predicates

By convention question mark suffix should be used for predicates only. It is like that in clojure core, and, if you like Appeal to Authority arguments, Stuart Holloway [also said so](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/clojure/IdSGKwTYqPU/QC0udWGuLMQJ). Example:

{% highlight clojure %}
(some? maybe-sheep)
{% endhighlight %}

## Don't: Booleans

Vars and bindings containing boolean values should not end with question mark:

{% highlight clojure %}
(let [disabled? (empty? options)]
  (if disabled? ;; meh
    (do-nothing)
    (do-something options)))
{% endhighlight %}

It's simple to understand what's wrong here: `disabled?` is not a predicate. Predicate is a question, calling a predicate is asking a question and getting answer, and `disabled?` in this case is an answer. Answer to the question is affirmative: we know for sure that it is either `true` or `false`, so there is nothing questionable here. Also, using question mark here introduces confusion, because now we have symbols ending with `?` that are either functions or booleans.

## Don't: Keywords

With keywords situation starts to get blurry, because they can be invoked as functions, so it is tempting to put question mark at the end of a keyword:

{% highlight clojure %}
(filter :online? users) ;; okay?..
{% endhighlight %}

I thinks this is a bad idea, because even though being a function is very valuable for keywords, their main use case is being identifiers for data. Using keywords as identifiers is affirmative, there are no questions here, only assertions of facts:

{% highlight clojure %}
(def system-user
  {:login "system"
   :online? true}) ;; meh
{% endhighlight %}

Also, if you destructure map with such keys, you will again end up in a situation where you have a boolean binding ending with `?`:

{% highlight clojure %}
(let [{:keys [login online?]} user]
  [:div (str login 
             (when online? ;; meh
               " ●"))])
{% endhighlight %}

In my experience I've seen more uses of such keywords as data identifiers in destructurings than as predicates.

## Rarely Do: Keywords

I think an exception here could be a keyword that identifies predicate function:

{% highlight clojure %}
{:type :goblin
 :will-attack? #(> 10 (:strength %))}
{% endhighlight %}

Destructuring it will give you a `?`-ending predicate that you can call and get an answer, which makes sense.

What do you think?
